# Intro
This  is  a repository about  the book --- Core Java Fundamentals Eleventh Edition by Cay S. Horstmann.
The modules which begin with Chap are from Volume 1, and those starting with V2 are from Volume 2.


# Thoughts
Personally, it is a nice book, however, but not suitable for a beginner. 
If you are a novice to java, I recommend you  to take a course instead of reading this material directly, 
for you might be confused about what are the key points in a bewildering amount of information!!!  

There is a wildly-acclaimed course in Udemy  called [Java 17 Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/), 
which I intend to take. Well, what’s more to say is **PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE**！
